Cheminformatics-algorithms
===
This is a Haskell-based implementation of various graph algorithms frequently employed in cheminformatics. However, their use is not limited to cheminformatics alone. The project was initiated as a personal endeavor in 2013 and, to date, remains in the early stages of development.

Backend
===
We utilize fgl as the Haskell graph library.

Current features
===
* Implementation of the VF2 algorithm for graph isomorphism checks,   (QuickCheck tests).
********** Implementation of the algorithm for exhaustive subgraphs enumeration. (QuickCheck tests). 

To do
==
A lot.
